Welcome to your Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Project

1. The Resources directory contains the source code for the Android and iPhone app to display Open Badges.  It uses JSON to communicate with the Mozilla project.

2. You will need the custom Info.plist file if you chose to submit the project to the iOS app store.  It contains pointers to additional icons.
